# My Kotlin Learning Journey
I do learning-by-doing in this repo, and I make some violations on purpose like the weird package names just to make sure what is the sequence of the contents, so please do not judge me on this :)

## My Main Resources
I'm using multiple resources to study and apply what I learn here with examples. This is a list of **main** resources I use (_I will update this list whenever I use a new resource_):

* [Kotlin for Java Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers). A free course by JetBrains (The company behind Kotlin).
Taught by:
   - [Svetlana Isakova](https://twitter.com/sveta_isakova) - Developer Advocate @ JetBrains, co-author of [Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action) and [Atomic Kotlin](https://leanpub.com/AtomicKotlin) books.
   - [Andrey Breslav](https://twitter.com/abreslav) - One of the creators of the Kotlin language.
